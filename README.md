## Purpose

App that you can use to generate recipes based on available ingredients.

## Built with

- HTML (Daniel Love)
- CSS (A'Darius Ellis)
- JavaScript (Michael Hodges)
- Bootstrap (A'Darius Ellis)

## Challenges

- Our biggest challenge was creating the local storage where it was linked to both our main and sub index pages.

- Another issue was solving our Api quota where the application will function during testing. Our only solution was to register with a second API key.
