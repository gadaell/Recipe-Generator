## Purpose/User Story

App that you can use to generate recipes based on available ingredients.
AS A person at home wanting to cook a meal with limited ingredients. 
I WANT to look at the recipe Generator and be given a text input to enter my ingredients.
SO THAT when I submit those ingredients a recipe that includes my ingredients is generated. 
GIVEN that I put in my ingredients.
WHEN I Submit those ingredients.  
THEN I expect to see my recipe. 
WHEN I click on Recipe History
THEN I expect to see my prior Recipe Results. 
WHEN I click on a Saved Recipe Name. 
THEN I am presented with the recipe card again.

## Challenges

- Our biggest challenge was creating the local storage where it was linked to both our main and sub index pages.

- Another issue was solving our Api quota where the application will function during testing. Our only solution was to register with a second API key.
